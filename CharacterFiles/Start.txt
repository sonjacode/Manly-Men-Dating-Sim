Starting Monologue

Holy shit, I have a bomb inside my body, and the bastards wired it so if my heart rate goes below a 

number it blows.
Do I know that number? No. Do -they- know that number? Of course not.
Holy.
Fucking.
Shit.
I've never been this pissed off, ever. All my life I, Joseph Joestar, was meant to be a suicide bomber, 

and now I'm not even going to be able to set myself off at the right place or time. 
Why are my kin so incompetent? Can't even wire a fucking bomb properly...

*breathes*

As long as my heart rate stays up, I'll be good. For now, I'm angry as hell so that should keep me going 
for a good bit. But it won't last forever, as I get happy too easily... 
I need something more permanent. Hmm... walking on pins? nah, I don't want it to be that painful. 
Running? I've never been much of a runner... Flying a plane without having a license? Sounds great, but 
I won't ever get to my precise location that way. I need something that always keeps my heart racing, 
and is small enough to take with me to bombing targets.

Wait, I've got it!
I'll fall in love.
